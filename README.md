How to use it
    1. we support two kinds of path
        absolute path: start with "/", such as /readme.txt
            absolute path means the path is start from the root path of the project.
            Example in the project, it start from /home/youmi/workspace/pythonWeb
        reference path: not start with "/", such as readme.txt
            it means the path is reference the path of the file you use now.

    2. you must config the server at first in /conf/youmiweb_config.ini

    3. There is one example can show you how to use it, see:
